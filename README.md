# Welcome to my very-first *(My)SQL* task!

At [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/) we had a shorter task to get acquainted with [*MySQL*](https://dev.mysql.com). (This was necessary because of a [newer order](https://github.com/KoicsD/BloodDonationAppp/TaskDescription/OrdersWeek7.md) of the [*Blood Donation App*](https://github.com/KoicsD/BloodDonationApp/) known from repository [CharliesAngels](https://github.com/KoicsD/CharliesAngels).)  
[Task Description can be found here.](TaskDescription.md)

In the directory [*general*](general/) there is the solution for the common task.

In the directory [*custom*](custom/) you can find my own solution to the custom task. I was not too creative, but it is ready. (Good, a diagram is missing -- YET).

### An extra idea:
One of my friends at *CodeCool* had a problem: He installed [*python*](https://www.python.org) *3.4* next to [*python*](https://www.python.org) *3.5* because [*MySQL connector*](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/) does not work with *3.5* (unless you apply some tricks). Each time you tried to run [*python*](https://www.python.org), you had to explain to Windows, that *3.4* should be run instead of *3.5*, which made running very difficult. For this reason I wrote him a .bat file which contained the appropriate command. And then I realised: It is much more easy to simply double-click on a file instead of setting up the [*MySQL*](https://dev.mysql.com) server and then starting the python files separatedly. That is the reason why I have added [Week7A.bat](Week7A.bat).

Thank you for visiting this repository! :D
